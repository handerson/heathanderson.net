I spend about eight hours a day looking at text in Textmate, but I've never really thought about the font. I didn't even know what font I was using. So I decided to do some research.</p>

<p>Apparently I was using Monaco 12pt.</p>

<p>As you can see it is a little largish, but it never really bothered me. I began to search for other fonts to try. The first resource I found was Jeff Atwood's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/12/progamming-fonts.html">Programming Fonts</a> post. I saw nothing that made me want to switch even temporarily. Next I looked at <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts">Top 10 Programming Fonts</a>. I decided I might as well try out a couple of these fonts, even if just for a few minutes. I downloaded <a href="http://www.dafont.com/monofur.font">Monofur</a>, <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a>, and <a href="http://damieng.com/blog/2008/05/26/envy-code-r-preview-7-coding-font-released">Envy Code R</a>. Envy Code R wasn't mentioned in the list, but it was brought up in the comments and in the Hacker News thread above. </p>

<p>There seems to be no 'best' font. Font preference seems to vary immensely from person to person. I had a hard time deciding if I actually have a preference. After a couple of days of font switching I finally decided on Inconsolata 12pt. I really don't know why. That makes it impossible for me to actually suggest a font to someone else, but I do recommend trying out some different fonts and seeing if one of them makes your time staring at text a little more pleasant. </p>

<p>Here is what my screen looks like now:</p>

<p>One final note on anti aliasing: It seems that I like it (at least with Inconsolata and Monaco), some people do not. As with font choice I suggest trying it out and seeing for yourself.</p>
