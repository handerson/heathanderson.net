The new address is <a href="http://www.heathanderson.net">http://www.heathanderson.net</a>; http://www.blogofheath.com will redirect there.</p>

<p>I hope to posting *something* at least once a month. I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but I've had a blog for about a year and only have four previous posts. That is kind of pathetic. I'm planning on posting more than just code related stuff, so-- if programming doesn't interest you --maybe all hope of you reading future posts isn't lost.</p>

<p>What am I using to generate this site? Here is the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/rfelix/jekyll_ext">jekyll_ext</a>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/rfelix/my_jekyll_extensions">rfelix's plugins</a>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/seaofclouds/tweet">tweet</a>
  <li><a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>
  <li><a href="http://swip.codylindley.com/DOMWindowDemo.html">DOMwindow</a>
  <li><a href="http://themeforest.net/item/clean-blog/49983">Clean Blog</a> theme
  <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/badge.gne">Flickr Badge Generator</a>
</ul>

<p>I'm hosting this on <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a>. Server side is the usual--Apache. I'm deploying using git's post receive hook. It is pretty sweet.</p>
