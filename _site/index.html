     <h3><a href="/2012/12/01/hidden-radio-bluetooth-speaker" rel="bookmark" title="Hidden Radio Bluetooth Speaker">Hidden Radio Bluetooth Speaker</a></h3>
     
     <p>I didn&#8217;t get off to a great start with the Hidden Radio Bluetooth speaker. I was impatient so I tried to use it just a few minutes after plugging the speaker for its initial charge. My phone started randomly disconnecting from the speaker. This problem went away after letting the speaker charge for a couple of hours. </p>

<p>Another problem I ran into was with the twist to control mechanism. The Hidden Radio is turned on by twisting the top part of the speaker. This also increases the volume. The problem was with the base. It wouldn&#8217;t easily stay in place while turning its top. I was having to push down and turn. This didn&#8217;t work very well. </p>

<p>I eventually found that cleaning the grippy material on the base with some water completely fixed the issue. Hopefully this isn&#8217;t something that has to be done too often. </p>

<p>I have the silver colored one. I don&#8217;t really care for the plastic-aping-metal look. It looks fine, but I think I would go with black if I had the chance. </p>

<p>I am mostly using the speaker to listen to podcasts, and I have no complaints with regards to audio quality or volume. It seems roughly comparable to other speakers of it&#8217;s size. </p>

<p>The location of the micro USB port is annoying. It is on the bottom of the speaker at an odd angle. I find it difficult to both insert and remove the USB cable. This port charges the speaker. The Hidden Radio has a built in battery and is meant to be portable. I would be more likely to use it this way if the charging cable port was more accessible. </p>

<p>The brightness of the the always-on (when plugged in) indicator light is another annoyance. I do have some <a href="https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/eeb6/">light blocker stickers</a> that help the situation. I wish the light would go off or dim significantly once the speaker is charged and turned off.</p>

<p>Although I do like the simplictiy of its design, I don&#8217;t think I would pay $119 (the Kickstarter price) for it again. I would probably go cheaper with <a href="http://amzn.com/B0083UU1OO">GOgroove BlueSYNC OR3</a>, or more expensive and look at the <a href="http://amzn.com/B004E10KI8">Jawbone JAMBOX</a>. The retail price for the Hidden Radio is $149. </p>

     <h3><a href="/2012/12/01/do-i-really-need-an-iphone-dock" rel="bookmark" title="Do I Really Need An iPhone Dock?">Do I Really Need An iPhone Dock?</a></h3>
     
     <p>Probably not. But I&#8217;m still using it. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used the Elevation Dock with Lightning Adapter for a couple of weeks now. Using the dock for another week really hasn&#8217;t done much to improve my opinion of the gadget. </p>

<p>It is easier to put the phone in the dock than to directly plug in the lightning cable. On the other hand it is much easier to disconnect the cable than to undock the phone. I&#8217;m not sure how to weigh these two facts against each other. At best it is a wash. </p>

<p>Right now I&#8217;m mostly continuing to use the dock because I like the way it looks. I suppose I will continue to use the Elevation Dock until I either find something better or get frustrated enough with the undocking procedure to decide to go dock-less. </p>

<p>Or I may actually try some kind of adhesive to attach the dock to my night stand. That seems like a really bad idea, right? </p>

     <h3><a href="/2012/11/25/the-elevation-dock-lightning-adapter" rel="bookmark" title="The Elevation Dock Lightning Adapter">The Elevation Dock Lightning Adapter</a></h3>
     
     <p><img src="/images/posts/lightning-adapter.jpg" alt="Elevation Dock Lightning Adapter" class="shadow" />Earlier this year I received my <a href="http://www.elevationlab.com/products/elevationdock-for-iphone4">Elevation Dock</a> after funding the Kickstarter. I loved it. It was the absolutely the best docking solution available. Due to its low friction connector and heft it was even easier to use than just a cable. I could drop in my phone to charge, then grab it and go. No hassles. </p>

<p>Getting the iPhone 5 kind of ruined that arrangement for me. I've been stuck charging with a plain cable (awful, I know). At least with the Lightning cable I could plug it in without having to study it to make sure I'm inserting it correctly.</p>

<p>Thankfully Elevation Lab has released a <a href="http://www.elevationlab.com/products/lightning-adapter">Lightning adapter</a>. I ordered one as soon as they were available. It arrived earlier this week. </p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/lightning-adapter-installed.jpg" alt="Elevation Dock Lightning Adapter Installed" class="shadow right" />Installing the adapter was easy enough. Luckily I had an extra Lightning cable to use with it. The adapter looks nice, and works well enough. The main problem is that Apple's Lightning connector produces too much friction to undock the phone with one hand. I now have to hold down the dock to get my phone. </p>

<p>
According to Elevation Lab:
  <blockquote>
    The lightning connector, like all of Apple's 30pin connectors, are higher friction than our custom 30pin connectors shipped with your docks. But with the ElevationDock's weight, just some pressure from your pinky and you can remove your phone without the base moving.
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p> I had this information before ordering the adapter. In theory I could still remove the phone with one hand--all I would need to do is press down with my pinky on the dock and get the phone with my other digits. In practice I have not been able to make that work. It is a two handed affair to undock my phone. So goes one of the best features of the original Elevation Dock</p>

<p>I still like the dock. The iPhone 5 version just isn't as useful as the 4/4S one. The Lightning adapter is well made, and I don't think they could have done a better job. It is my understanding that it is currently impossible for 3rd parties to create their own versions of Apple's Lightning connector. This means that Elevation Lab has made the best possible product given the current limitations.</p>

<p>The Elevation Dock is still the best iPhone dock I have found.</p>

     <h3><a href="/2012/11/25/a-new-look" rel="bookmark" title="A New Look">A New Look</a></h3>
     
     <p><img src="/images/posts/old-site.jpg" alt="Old Blog Design Closeup" class="shadow" />I've finally updated my blog again. I've thrown away most of the old style and code. I needed a new look. Apparently a year ago I was a bit obsessed with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">low contrast</a> and <a href="http://webdesignandsuch.com/apple-linen-texture-effect-web-design-trend-download-tutorial/">textures</a>. These design concepts can work wonderfully. On my site they did not. I needed a new inspiration. One was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>About a month ago I started watching <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/whitecollar/">White Collar</a>. I really liked the <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:White_Collar_2009_logo.svg">logo</a>. It stuck with me. Last Friday I had a day off, so I decided to see if I was indeed "inspired". I suppose I was close enough. I am much happier with the current site design than the old one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/site-design.png" alt="Blog Design Closeup" class="shadow right" />The rest of this paragraph may sound pretentious, and I apologize for that; however, I hope it gives some insight into the new design. The basic design language is that of a blue background overlain with a white sheet of material. The header and footer are on peeking out of the background. The blue headings and the date boxes are carved out of the white foreground to reveal the blue underneath. The white lettering in the header, footer, and date boxes are meant to be leftovers from white foreground material. The black text and images in the body of the page are sitting on top of the white foreground. </p> 

<p>I also can't help but try out some new (to me) technologies, especially if they might be useful in my day job. I've used a bit of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> in the context of <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/rails-3-1-adopts-coffeescript-jquery-sass-and-controversy-4669.html">Rails</a> before, but I was interested in learning more about it. And this <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> thing I kept hearing about sounded really useful.</p>

<p>It turns out that I really like Sass and Compass. Together they give a front-end developer many wondrous tools. It would be hard to go back to not using variables and mixins. I also found <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a>, a responsive grid framework, to be very useful. </a></p>

<p>Integrating Jekyll and Sass was not as easy as I had hoped. I at first tried the <a href="https://github.com/noct/jekyll-sass">jeklyy-sass</a> gem. I could not get it work after about half an hour of futzing with it. I assume this failing was on my part, not that of the gem. I think decided to do something a bit more simple. I followed the <a href="http://martinciu.com/2011/06/blogging-like-a-hacker-using-jekyll-compass-and-foreman.html">advice</a> of another blog and just used the Jekyll and Compass command separately with <a href="http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/">foreman</a> gluing them together.</p>

<p>I also took the opportunity to research fonts/typefaces to use. All really knew was that I wanted a strong sans serif font for the headings and a nice readable serif font for the body text. I did find two fonts that I really liked:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://fontdeck.com/font/groteskurw/regular">Grotesk URW</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://fontdeck.com/font/skolar/regular">Skolar</a></li>
  </ul>
Eventually I decided that it really didn't make sense to pay for fonts on a blog that no one actually reads. So I decided to look up what fonts are <a href="http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html">installed by default</a> and pick the my favorites (as it were). I landed on Verdana for the headings and Georgia for the body. 
</p>

<p>I did wind up using one custom font: <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a>. I use this font in my text editor, so I decided to make the code snippets on my site use it. I found Font Squirrel's <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator">@font-face generator</a> very useful</p>

<p> I couldn't figure out how to display each post's date until I stumbled across this post about <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-text-rotation">CSS text rotation</a>. I also had to <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understanding-css3-transitions/">brush up on CSS3 transitions</a> to create the header. Making text look indented (or a letterpress effect) with CSS is surprisingly difficult. I found this <a href="https://gist.github.com/1609945">gist</a> incredibly useful.</p>

<p>I'm still not done. There are still some bugs especially on mobile devices. I will continue to refine and fix. Hopefully this version lasts longer than a year.</p>

     <p>The fact that you can add a splash screen to your PhoneGap app on the Android platform is surprisingly hard to come across. After some searching I did find some answers. </p>
